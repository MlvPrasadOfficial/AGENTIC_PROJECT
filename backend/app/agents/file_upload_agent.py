    📁 FILE UPLOAD AGENT - The Gateway to Data Processing
    
    COMPREHENSIVE AGENT EXPLANATION:
    ================================
    
    PURPOSE & ROLE:
    The File Upload Agent serves as the entry point for the Enterprise Insights Copilot 
    system. It acts as the first validator and processor in the 8-agent pipeline, ensuring 
    that uploaded files meet system requirements before proceeding to analysis.

    CORE RESPONSIBILITIES:
    1. FILE VALIDATION:
       - Validates file formats (CSV, XLSX, JSON, TXT, PDF)
       - Checks file size limits (up to 100MB)
       - Verifies file integrity and structure
       - Ensures proper encoding detection
    
    2. FILE PROCESSING:
       - Extracts metadata (filename, size, type, creation date)
       - Performs initial content analysis
       - Generates unique file IDs for tracking
       - Creates file summaries for downstream agents
    
    3. SYSTEM CONNECTIVITY VALIDATION:
       - Executes 6 comprehensive Pinecone validation tests
       - Verifies vector database connectivity and performance
       - Tests embedding operations with real data

    4. SECURITY & SAFETY:
       - Scans for malicious content
       - Validates file headers and signatures
       - Implements virus scanning (configurable)
       - Prevents directory traversal attacks
    
    5. PREPROCESSING:
       - Converts files to standardized formats
       - Handles character encoding normalization
       - Extracts text content from complex formats
       - Generates initial data quality metrics

    INTEGRATION POINTS:
    - Input: Raw file uploads from frontend
    - Output: Validated file metadata + processed content + Pinecone test results
    - Next Agent: Data Profile Agent (for structure analysis)
    - Storage: Local file system + database metadata
    - Vector DB: Pinecone index for embedding validation
    
    TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE:
    - Base Class: BaseAgent (LangChain-powered)
    - File Service: Handles physical file operations
    - Validation Engine: Multi-layer security checks
    - Format Converters: Standardize various file types
    - Metadata Extractor: Generates comprehensive file info
    - Pinecone Integration: Real-time vector database testing
    
    ERROR HANDLING STRATEGY:
    - Unsupported formats → Clear error messages with supported format list
    - Oversized files → Graceful rejection with size alternatives
    - Corrupted files → Partial recovery attempts with diagnostic info
    - Permission issues → Fallback storage options and retry logic
    - Pinecone failures → Individual test isolation, detailed error reporting
    - Import failures → Graceful degradation with informative messages
    
    PERFORMANCE FEATURES:
    - Async processing for large files (non-blocking operations)
    - Progress tracking for user feedback (real-time updates)
    - Chunked processing for memory efficiency (streaming approach)
    - Caching for repeated uploads (deduplication support)
    - Lazy initialization for Pinecone imports (performance optimization)
    - Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
    
    MONITORING & OBSERVABILITY:
    - Real-time upload progress tracking
    - Detailed error logging with stack traces
    - Performance metrics collection (timing, throughput)
    - Security event tracking (malicious file attempts)
    - Pinecone connectivity health monitoring
    - Resource usage tracking (memory, CPU, storage)
    
    CODE QUALITY STANDARDS:
    - Comprehensive type hints throughout (maintainability)
    - Extensive docstrings and inline comments (documentation)
    - Error handling with specific exception types (reliability)
    - Async/await patterns for I/O operations (performance)
    - Modular design with single responsibility methods (testability)
    - Constants for string literals (maintainability)
    - Clean separation of concerns (architecture)
    
    This agent is critical for system reliability as it prevents invalid data from 
    entering the processing pipeline, ensures consistent data quality standards,
    and validates the health of the vector database infrastructure before any
    downstream processing begins.

        Initialize the File Upload Agent with comprehensive configuration.
        
        This constructor sets up the File Upload Agent with all necessary components
        for file validation, processing, and Pinecone integration testing. It
        establishes the foundation for the first stage of the 8-agent pipeline.

            - File service instance for file operations
            - Supported file formats validation list
            - Maximum file size limits from settings
            - Upload directory path configuration
            - Automatic directory creation if needed
            
        Post-Initialization State:
            - Agent is ready to process file upload requests
            - File service is initialized and ready
            - Upload directory exists and is accessible
            - Supported formats are validated against settings

        Technical Details:
            - Agent type: "file_upload" (string identifier)
            - Agent name: "File Upload Agent" (human-readable name)
            - File service: Handles physical file operations and metadata
            - Upload directory: Created from settings.UPLOAD_DIR configuration
            - Supported formats: Defined in settings.ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS
            - Maximum file size: Configured via settings.MAX_FILE_SIZE
            
        Error Handling:
            - Directory creation failures are logged but not fatal

            - Invalid configurations will raise ValueError
            - File service initialization errors are propagated
            
        Performance Considerations:

            - Upload directory path is resolved to absolute path
            - All configurations are cached for fast access
            
        Security Features:
            - Upload directory is validated for write permissions
            - File extensions are strictly validated against whitelist
            - File size limits are enforced at the agent level
            - Directory traversal attacks are prevented
            
        Logging:
            - Initialization success/failure is logged
            - Directory creation events are logged
            - Configuration validation results are logged

        Returns:
            None (constructor method)
            
        Raises:
            ImportError: If required dependencies are missing
            ValueError: If configuration is invalid
            OSError: If directory creation fails with insufficient permissions

        file size limits, format compatibility, and physical file existence.
        
        Validation Checks:

               - Provides clear error message with supported formats
               
            3. File Existence Validation:
               - Verifies file exists at expected storage location
