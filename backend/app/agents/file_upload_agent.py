    📁 FILE UPLOAD AGENT - The Gateway to Data Processing
    
    COMPREHENSIVE AGENT EXPLANATION:
    ================================
    
    PURPOSE & ROLE:
    The File Upload Agent serves as the entry point for the Enterprise Insights Copilot 
    system. It acts as the first validator and processor in the 8-agent pipeline, ensuring 
    that uploaded files meet system requirements before proceeding to analysis.
    
    CORE RESPONSIBILITIES:
    1. FILE VALIDATION:
       - Validates file formats (CSV, XLSX, JSON, TXT, PDF)
       - Checks file size limits (up to 100MB)
       - Verifies file integrity and structure
       - Ensures proper encoding detection
    
    2. FILE PROCESSING:
       - Extracts metadata (filename, size, type, creation date)
       - Performs initial content analysis
       - Generates unique file IDs for tracking
       - Creates file summaries for downstream agents
    
    3. SECURITY & SAFETY:
       - Scans for malicious content
       - Validates file headers and signatures
       - Implements virus scanning (configurable)
       - Prevents directory traversal attacks
    
    4. PREPROCESSING:
       - Converts files to standardized formats
       - Handles character encoding normalization
       - Extracts text content from complex formats
       - Generates initial data quality metrics
    
    INTEGRATION POINTS:
    - Input: Raw file uploads from frontend
    - Output: Validated file metadata + processed content
    - Next Agent: Data Profile Agent (for structure analysis)
    - Storage: Local file system + database metadata
    
    TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE:
    - Base Class: BaseAgent (LangChain-powered)
    - File Service: Handles physical file operations
    - Validation Engine: Multi-layer security checks
    - Format Converters: Standardize various file types
    - Metadata Extractor: Generates comprehensive file info
    
    ERROR HANDLING:
    - Unsupported formats → Clear error messages
    - Oversized files → Graceful rejection with alternatives
    - Corrupted files → Partial recovery attempts
    - Permission issues → Fallback storage options
    
    PERFORMANCE FEATURES:
    - Async processing for large files
    - Progress tracking for user feedback
    - Chunked processing for memory efficiency
    - Caching for repeated uploads
    
    MONITORING & LOGGING:
    - Real-time upload progress
    - Detailed error logging
    - Performance metrics collection
    - Security event tracking
    
    This agent is critical for system reliability as it prevents invalid data from 
    entering the processing pipeline and ensures consistent data quality standards.

        Initialize the File Upload Agent with comprehensive configuration.
        
        This constructor sets up the File Upload Agent with all necessary components
        for file validation, processing, and Pinecone integration testing. It
        establishes the foundation for the first stage of the 8-agent pipeline.
        
        Initialization Components:
            - Base agent configuration with name and type
            - File service instance for file operations

            - Maximum file size limits from settings
            - Upload directory path configuration
            - Automatic directory creation if needed
            
        Post-Initialization State:
            - Agent is ready to process file upload requests
            - File service is initialized and ready
            - Upload directory exists and is accessible
            - Supported formats are validated against settings
            - All file size limits are properly configured
            
        Dependencies:
            - settings: Application configuration
