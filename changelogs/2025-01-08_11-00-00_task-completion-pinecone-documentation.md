### 📋 TASK OVERVIEW
This changelog documents the completion of Task-01 (Pinecone Configuration Updates) and Task-02 (Code Quality Improvements) for the Enterprise Insights Copilot project.

### 🎯 TASK-01: PINECONE CONFIGURATION UPDATES
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Objective**: Update Pinecone integration to version 7.3.0 with new API configuration

#### 🔧 Core Changes:
1. **Environment Configuration Update**
   - File: `c:\JUL7PROJECT\backend\.env`
   - Added: `PINECONE_API_KEY=pcsk_32sAjo_GBmHb65fWYgzsa9vviAeRjX5xMAERPCBnQpQ2BSsbDv57hx3dkJpwJiejA8RRjQ`
   - Impact: Production-ready Pinecone authentication

2. **Dependencies Modernization**
   - File: `c:\JUL7PROJECT\backend\requirements.txt`
   - Removed: `sentence-transformers>=2.2.2`
   - Rationale: Pinecone 7.3.0 provides native embedding service

3. **Vector Store Implementation Update**
   - File: `c:\JUL7PROJECT\backend\app\db\vector_store.py`
   - Enhanced: `generate_embedding()` method for Pinecone 7.3.0 compatibility
   - Added: Native Pinecone embedding service integration
   - Removed: External sentence-transformers dependency
   - Implemented: Fallback mock embeddings for development
