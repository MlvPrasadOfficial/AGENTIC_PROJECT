# 2025-07-07: API URL Configuration Fix

## Issue: Duplicate API Path Prefixes

**Problem**: The system was experiencing 404 errors during file uploads due to duplicate API path prefixes, resulting in invalid URLs like:
```
POST /api/v1/api/v1/files/upload HTTP/1.1
```

**Root Cause**: 
- The `environmentService.apiUrl` was set to `http://localhost:8000/api/v1`
- When combined with the API path in `fileService.uploadFile('/files/upload')` and the backend API prefix, it created a duplicate `/api/v1` segment

**Fix**:
1. Modified `environmentService.ts` to remove the `/api/v1` path from the default API URL:
   ```typescript
   get apiUrl(): string {
     return process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || 'http://localhost:8000';
   }
   ```

2. Added documentation comments explaining the proper configuration to prevent this issue in the future

3. Created a new documentation file: `frontend/docs/api-path-configuration.md` to explain the correct API URL configuration pattern

4. Created tests to verify the fix works correctly

## Impact

- File upload functionality now works correctly
- API requests are properly formed with the correct path structure: `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/files/upload`
- Improved documentation to prevent similar issues in the future

## Additional Quality Improvements

- Added comprehensive documentation for API path construction
- Created tests to verify the API URL configuration 
- Added helpful comments to the code explaining the API URL structure
