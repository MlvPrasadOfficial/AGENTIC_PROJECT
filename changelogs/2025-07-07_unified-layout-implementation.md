# Purpose: Document unified layout implementation and home UI refactoring

## Overview
Implementation of the unified 3-section layout as specified in `10-frontend-home-ui-layout.txt` to fix home UI layout mismatch.

## Changes Made

### 2025-07-07 14:30:00 - Layout Architecture Refactor
**Features:**
- Created `UnifiedLayout` component implementing exact 3-section design:
  1. Fixed Header Navigation (Full-Width)
  2. 2-Column Main Content (40% Left / 60% Right)  
  3. Full-Width Visualization Dashboard
- Refactored `page.tsx` to use `UnifiedLayout` wrapper
- Removed duplicate header rendering from `layout.tsx`
- Fixed layout structure conflicts

**Bug Fixes:**
- Fixed home UI not matching intended layout diagram
- Resolved header duplication between layout.tsx and page.tsx
- Fixed background and container conflicts
- Corrected column proportions (40%/60% instead of previous 2/3 split)

**Breaking Changes:**
- `page.tsx` now uses `UnifiedLayout` component instead of direct layout implementation
- Removed header from `layout.tsx` as it's now handled by unified layout
- Changed column grid from `lg:grid-cols-5` to `lg:grid-cols-10` for proper 40%/60% split

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/app/page.tsx` - Complete rewrite using UnifiedLayout
- `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx` - Removed header rendering
- `frontend/src/components/layout/unified-layout.tsx` - Previously created

**Technical Details:**
- Fixed header positioning with proper z-index (z-50)
- Implemented proper spacing with pt-16 for header offset
- Maintained responsive breakpoints for mobile/tablet/desktop
- Preserved glassmorphic design system consistency
- Added proper error boundaries and loading states

## Next Steps
- Test the unified layout in development environment
- Verify responsive behavior across all breakpoints
- Ensure all feature components render correctly in new layout structure
