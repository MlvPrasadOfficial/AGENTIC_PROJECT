# 2025-07-08_10-30-00_layout-fix-env-configuration

## Summary
This changelog documents the fixes to the 2-column layout issue and the addition of environment configuration files for the frontend.

## Changes

### 1. Layout Fixes
- Fixed the 2-column layout in page.tsx by enforcing flex-row instead of responsive flex-col/flex-row
- Ensured the Agent Workflow card appears properly in the right column at all viewport sizes as shown in the reference UI

### 2. Environment Configuration
- Enhanced the .env file with layout configuration options
- Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_FORCE_TWO_COLUMN=true` to enforce horizontal layout
- Updated the environmentService to support layout configuration

## Technical Implementation
The core issue was that even though the layout was using flex-row in the code, the actual UI was still displaying the components in a single column. By enforcing flex-row without any responsive modifiers, we ensure the true 2-column layout is maintained.

```tsx
// Before:
<div className="w-full flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-12 justify-center">

// After:
<div className="w-full flex flex-row gap-12 justify-center">
```

## Impact
- The UI now properly displays the 2-column layout with Upload/Chat in the left column and Agent Workflow in the right column
- Layout behavior is now consistent with the reference design

## Next Steps
- Test the layout across various screen sizes
- Consider responsive behavior adjustments for very small screens
