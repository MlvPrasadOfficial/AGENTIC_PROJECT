# 2025-07-08_11-15-00_two-column-layout-width-fixes

## Summary
Fixed the 2-column layout issue where columns were still displaying in a single column despite having flex-row applied.

## Changes

### 1. Layout Width Adjustments
- Changed left column from `flex-1 max-w-md` to explicit `w-2/5` for 40% width
- Changed right column from `flex-1 max-w-xl` to explicit `w-3/5` for 60% width
- Reduced column gap from `gap-12` to `gap-8` for better space utilization
- Added `max-w-7xl` to the main container to ensure sufficient width on larger screens
- Changed container padding from `px-8` to `px-4` to provide more layout space

### 2. Layout Structure Enhancement
- Updated layout to use `justify-between` instead of `justify-center` to properly distribute the columns

## Technical Implementation
The core issue was that both columns had `flex-1` which allowed them to grow equally, but they also had max-width constraints:
- Left column: `max-w-md` (384px)
- Right column: `max-w-xl` (576px)

On certain screen sizes, these constraints prevented the columns from properly displaying side-by-side. By switching to explicit width percentages (40%/60%), we ensure the two-column layout displays correctly at all reasonable viewport sizes.

## Impact
- The UI now properly displays the 2-column layout with Upload/Chat in the left column (40%) and Agent Workflow in the right column (60%)
- Layout is consistent with the reference design in the screenshot
- The layout will maintain proper proportions across screen sizes

## Next Steps
- Consider additional responsiveness improvements for very small screens
- Verify layout on ultrawide monitors
