# 2025-07-08_12-00-00_layout-spacing-and-agent-names

## Summary
Made improvements to the UI layout spacing and updated agent names to match the specifications from the structure documentation.

## Changes

### 1. Layout Spacing Adjustments
- Increased spacing between columns from `gap-6` to `gap-10` for better visual separation
- Increased margin after the main heading from `mb-12` to `mb-16` to create more breathing room

### 2. Agent Names Updates
- Updated agent names to match the structure documentation:
  - Changed "Data Agent" to "File Upload Agent"
  - Changed "Cleaner Agent" to "Data Profile Agent"
  - Updated dependency references to match the new agent names
  - Fixed associated status messages to be consistent with the new agent names

## Technical Implementation
The implementation maintains the forced 2-column layout while improving the spacing and accuracy of the agent names. These changes ensure the UI matches the exact specifications in the structure/11.txt and frontend_layout.txt documentation files.

## Impact
- Better visual separation between columns
- More spacious layout with improved vertical rhythm
- Agent names that accurately reflect their purpose and match the original specification

## Next Steps
- Consider reviewing the remaining agent names and ensuring they all match the structure documentation
- Evaluate if additional padding or margin adjustments are needed for optimal visual hierarchy
