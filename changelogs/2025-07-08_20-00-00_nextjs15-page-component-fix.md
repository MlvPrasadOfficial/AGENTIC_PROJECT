### Date: 2025-07-08 20:00:00

### Issue
The page.tsx file in the App Router structure was encountering JSX parsing errors due to incorrect component definition for Next.js 15 App Router.

### Changes
- Updated the page.tsx file to follow Next.js 15 App Router conventions
- Properly defined the page component as a default export function
- Added explicit React import to ensure proper JSX transformation
- Retained the same UI layout with 2-column structure
- Maintained glassmorphism design and all agent workflow elements

### Results
- Fixed the "Unexpected token `main`. Expected jsx identifier" error
- Application now compiles and renders properly
- Maintained all UI elements and layout structure

### Technical Details
Next.js 15 App Router requires page components to be defined in a specific way. The component was refactored to follow these conventions while maintaining the exact same UI layout and functionality.
