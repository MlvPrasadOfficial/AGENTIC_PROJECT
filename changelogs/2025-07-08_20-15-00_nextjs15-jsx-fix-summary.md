# Next.js 15 JSX Syntax Fix - Summary

## Date: 2025-07-08 20:15:00

### Problem Resolved
The Enterprise Insights Copilot frontend was encountering a JSX syntax error that prevented the Next.js application from compiling. The error was:

```
Unexpected token `main`. Expected jsx identifier
```

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue was related to how the page component was defined in the App Router structure of Next.js 15. The component was defined as an arrow function constant, but Next.js 15 App Router has specific requirements for page components:

1. Pages should be exported as default functions (not arrow functions)
2. In App Router, pages must follow certain conventions for proper rendering
3. Explicit React import was missing, which can sometimes cause JSX parsing issues

### Solutions Implemented

1. **Component Definition Fix**: Changed from arrow function to standard function export:
   ```jsx
   // OLD
   const HomePage = () => { ... };
   export default HomePage;
   
   // NEW
   export default function Page() { ... }
   ```

2. **Added Explicit React Import**: Added import statement to ensure proper JSX parsing
   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';
   ```

3. **Maintained UI Structure**: The 2-column layout with left column (upload above, chat below) and right column (agent workflow) was preserved with all styling and components intact.

### Project Standards Met
- Maintained glassmorphism design elements
- Kept the responsive layout (mobile-first approach with md: breakpoints)
- Preserved all agent workflow components in the right column
- Documented changes in the changelogs directory with proper timestamps
- Created implementation logs with detailed technical notes

### Next Steps
1. Complete test suite setup with Jest and React Testing Library
2. Implement actual functionality for file upload and chat components
3. Add state management for agent workflow status
4. Enhance the visualization area with interactive D3 charts
