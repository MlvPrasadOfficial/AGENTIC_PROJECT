## Date: 2025-07-08 22:45:00

## Problem Solved
Successfully resolved the JSX syntax error in the page.tsx file that was preventing compilation of the Next.js application.

## Key Fixes Implemented

### 1. Complete Code Rewrite
- Rewrote the page.tsx file from scratch to eliminate any potential syntax issues
- Used `React.Fragment` as the top-level wrapper to fix JSX structure
- Ensured proper React import with explicit import statement
- Cleaned code structure and removed any invisible characters

### 2. Code Organization Improvements
- Added comprehensive comments to all sections and components
- Organized code into logical blocks with proper indentation
- Enhanced file header with purpose and layout information
- Maintained consistent coding style throughout

### 3. Layout Structure Preservation
- Maintained the 40-60 column distribution using CSS Grid
- Kept the left column with Upload (top) and Chat (bottom) sections
- Preserved right column for Agent Workflow panel
- Retained the visualization area at the bottom
- Kept all glassmorphism styling intact

### 4. Backup Solutions
- Created a simplified version (simple-page.tsx) with inline styles as a backup
- Backed up the original file before making changes
- Minimized dependencies on external CSS files in the backup version

## Final Result
The page.tsx file now compiles correctly without JSX syntax errors, and the UI displays as intended with:
- Proper 2-column layout (40% left, 60% right)
- Left column showing Upload (top) and Chat (bottom)
- Right column showing Agent Workflow panel
- Full-width visualization area at the bottom
- Complete glassmorphism styling and effects

The application is now fully functional with the correct layout structure and styling.
