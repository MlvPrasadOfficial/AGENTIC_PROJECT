# Agent Count Correction

**Date:** July 8, 2025  
**Author:** GitHub Copilot  

## Changes Made

Updated the agent count references from 11 to 8 agents to match the actual implementation:

1. Updated page.tsx text from "11-agent pipeline for data analysis" to "8-agent pipeline for data analysis"
2. Updated progress indicator from "(0/11 complete)" to "(0/8 complete)"

This change ensures consistency between the actual implementation and the documentation.

## Files Changed

- `c:\JUL7PROJECT\frontend\src\app\page.tsx`

## Visual Changes

Updated text references to show the correct agent count throughout the interface.

## Next Steps

- Ensure all documentation references the correct agent count of 8
- Verify that the agent workflow displays all 8 required agents
