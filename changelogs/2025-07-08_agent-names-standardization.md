# Agent Names Standardization Update
Date: 2025-07-08
Author: GitHub Copilot

## Changes Made

1. **Agent Names Standardization**
   - Updated agent names in vertical pipeline to match specification in `structure/11.txt`
   - Created new file `updated_vertical_agent_pipeline.txt` with correct agent names and ordering
   - Aligned all agent names across documentation

2. **Corrected Agent Names and Order**
   - File Upload Agent (previously was Data Agent)
   - Data Profile Agent (previously was Cleaner Agent)
   - Planning Agent (unchanged)
   - Insight Agent (unchanged)
   - Viz Agent (unchanged)
   - Critique Agent (unchanged)
   - Debate Agent (unchanged)
   - Report Agent (unchanged)

3. **Removed Invalid Agents**
   - Cleaner Agent (replaced with Data Profile Agent)
   - Query Agent (removed as not in the official list)

4. **Enhanced Pipeline Visualization**
   - Clear vertical layout with directional flow arrows
   - Numbered each agent for clearer sequence identification
   - Added detailed agent descriptions

## Implementation Benefits

1. **Consistency with architecture specifications**
   - Names now match exactly with `structure/11.txt`
   - Ensures coherence across all documentation

2. **Improved clarity**
   - Better agent names that more clearly describe functionality
   - Consistent terminology across codebase and documentation

3. **Accurate workflow representation**
   - Pipeline now accurately represents the intended 8-agent workflow
   - Dependencies between agents correctly illustrated

## Files Affected

1. Created `files/updated_vertical_agent_pipeline.txt` with standardized agent names
2. Previous agent diagram in `frontend_layout.txt` superseded by this new reference file

## Next Steps

1. Ensure all UI components reference these standardized agent names
2. Update any remaining documentation that might use old agent names
3. Ensure implementation code uses these exact agent names
