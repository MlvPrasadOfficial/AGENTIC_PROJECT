# Agent Pipeline Correction

**Date:** July 8, 2025  
**Author:** GitHub Copilot  

## Changes Made

Updated the agent pipeline to match the 8-agent structure specified in structure/11.txt:

1. Removed SQL Agent (not in the specified 8-agent pipeline)
2. Removed Narrative Agent (not in the specified 8-agent pipeline)
3. Renamed "Chart Agent" to "Viz Agent" to match structure/11.txt naming

The correct 8 agents according to the specification are:
1. File Upload Agent (Data Agent)
2. Data Profile Agent (Cleaner Agent)
3. Planning Agent
4. Insight Agent
5. Viz Agent
6. Critique Agent
7. Debate Agent
8. Report Agent

## Files Changed

- `c:\JUL7PROJECT\frontend\src\app\page.tsx`

## Visual Changes

- Removed two agent cards from the pipeline
- Renamed "Chart Agent" to "Viz Agent"
- Pipeline is now correctly showing 8 agents as per the spec

## Next Steps

- Update all documentation to reflect the correct 8-agent pipeline
- Verify that all agent components are properly displayed with the correct naming
