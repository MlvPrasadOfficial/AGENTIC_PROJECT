# 8-Agent Pipeline Standardization Summary
Date: 2025-07-08
Author: GitHub Copilot

## Implementation Overview

The agent names and layout in the frontend have been updated to align with the specifications in `structure/11.txt`. This ensures consistency between the architecture documentation and the UI implementation.

## Changes Completed

1. **Agent Names Standardization**
   - Updated agent names to match structure/11.txt exactly:
     1. File Upload Agent (handles file uploads and initial validation)
     2. Data Profile Agent (analyzes data quality and structure)
     3. Planning Agent (parses queries and determines execution plan)
     4. Insight Agent (generates text insights using LLM)
     5. Viz Agent (creates data visualizations)
     6. Critique Agent (reviews outputs for quality)
     7. Debate Agent (provides multiple perspectives)
     8. Report Agent (assembles final outputs for download)

2. **Layout Improvements**
   - Created comprehensive vertical agent pipeline diagram in `updated_vertical_agent_pipeline.txt`
   - Added directional arrows to clearly show workflow sequence
   - Included numbered agents for clear process identification
   - Added detailed descriptions for each agent's responsibilities

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Updated `frontend_layout.txt` to reference the new agent names and layout
   - Enhanced Glass Card 3 description with the correct agent sequence
   - Created changelog entry documenting the standardization process

## Files Modified/Created

1. `files/updated_vertical_agent_pipeline.txt`: New detailed ASCII diagram with correct agent names
2. `files/frontend_layout.txt`: Updated references to agent names and layout
3. `changelogs/2025-07-08_agent-names-standardization.md`: Documentation of changes

## Verification

The updated agent pipeline:
- ✅ Contains exactly the 8 agents specified in structure/11.txt
- ✅ Uses the correct agent names as defined in the architecture
- ✅ Shows agents in a vertical stack with clear flow direction
- ✅ Maintains consistent styling and status indicators
- ✅ Includes detailed descriptions of each agent's function

## Next Steps

1. Update any UI components to display these agent names
2. Ensure backend API endpoints align with these standardized agent names
3. Update any remaining documentation that might use different agent terminology
