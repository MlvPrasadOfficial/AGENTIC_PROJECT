## Backend Implementation Progress Summary

Today we made significant progress on implementing the backend for the Enterprise Insights Copilot application. We focused on implementing the first three agents in the pipeline and setting up the LangGraph workflow to orchestrate them.

### Major Accomplishments

1. **Agent Implementations**:
   - Implemented `FileUploadAgent` for handling file validation and processing
   - Implemented `DataProfileAgent` for analyzing data structure and generating profiles
   - Implemented `PlanningAgent` for creating analysis plans based on data profile and user query

2. **Workflow Orchestration**:
   - Created `AgentWorkflow` class using LangGraph for agent orchestration
   - Implemented state management between agents
   - Added conditional routing based on agent outputs

3. **API Endpoints**:
   - Added `/api/v1/agents/workflow/run` endpoint to run the complete agent workflow
   - Updated API documentation and response models

### Implementation Details

#### File Upload Agent
- Validates file format and size
- Processes uploaded files for analysis
- Generates file structure information
- Optionally creates natural language summaries using LLM

#### Data Profile Agent
- Analyzes data structure and statistics
- Handles different data types appropriately
- Generates comprehensive profiles with missing value analysis
- Creates natural language insights about the data

#### Planning Agent
- Creates detailed analysis plans based on user query and data profile
- Recommends visualizations and metrics
- Identifies key areas for insights
- Structures output for downstream agents

#### LangGraph Workflow
- Manages state between agent executions
- Handles error conditions and recovery
- Provides unified interface for the complete agent pipeline
- Enables future extension to additional agents

### Next Steps

1. **Complete Missing Agents**:
   - Implement Insight Agent for generating insights using LLM
   - Implement Viz Agent for creating visualizations
   - Implement remaining agents (Critique, Debate, Report)

2. **LLM Integration**:
   - Set up connection to LLaMA 3.1
   - Implement caching for efficient resource usage

3. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Add unit tests for implemented components
   - Create integration tests for the workflow

## Task Status Update

We've updated the task status table in `TASKS.md` to reflect our progress. Four high-priority tasks have been completed:

1. ✅ File Upload Agent Implementation
2. ✅ Data Profile Agent Implementation
3. ✅ Planning Agent Implementation
4. ✅ LangGraph Workflow
5. ✅ Agent Endpoint Implementation

This represents significant progress toward our MVP goal of having the first three agents functioning in an orchestrated workflow.
