# Backend Task Reorganization

## Summary
- Reorganized the backend task table in TASKS.md
- Removed "Integration Tests" and "Performance Optimization" tasks from the list
- Reordered tasks by status (Completed, In Progress, Not Started) for better visibility
- Maintained all other sections of the document

## Changes Made
1. Tasks were reordered to group them by status (‚úÖ Complete, üü° In Progress, ‚ùå Not Started)
2. Removed "Integration Tests" task as it was no longer needed for this phase
3. Removed "Performance Optimization" task as requested
4. Retained all other tasks, priorities, and descriptions
5. Created a new version of the file to avoid formatting issues

## Next Steps
- Continue implementing the remaining backend components according to the updated task list
- Focus on completing the "In Progress" items first
- Start work on the "Not Started" high-priority tasks next
