# Changelog: FileService Promise Handling Fix

**Date:** 2025-07-08  
**Author:** GitHub Copilot  
**Type:** Bug Fix

## Description
Fixed inconsistent Promise handling in the `getSampleData` method in `fileService.ts`. The issue was related to mixing async/await with manual Promise creation in the error handling path, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

## Changes Made
- Updated the error handling logic in `getSampleData` to consistently use async/await pattern
- Replaced the manually created Promise with proper async/await pattern
- Maintained the delay functionality to simulate network latency for the mock data
- Ensured the method returns data in the same format for both success and error paths

## Benefits
- Improves code consistency and maintainability
- Reduces potential for Promise chain issues
- Makes the code more readable and follows modern JavaScript best practices

## Testing
- Verified no TypeScript errors after the change
- Confirmed functionality works in both normal and error handling paths

## Related Components
