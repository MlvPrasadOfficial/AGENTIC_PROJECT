# Frontend Layout Documentation Update

**Date:** July 8, 2025  
**Author:** GitHub Copilot  

## Changes Made

Updated the frontend documentation files to match the 8-agent structure from structure/11.txt:

1. **frontend_layout.txt Updates**:
   - Changed "Complete 11-agent workflow pipeline" to "Complete 8-agent workflow pipeline"
   - Updated progress indicator from "(0/11 complete)" to "(0/8 complete)"
   - Maintained the vertical agent layout as requested

2. **frontend_files.txt Updates**:
   - Changed "Agent-Specific Components (11 Agents)" to "Agent-Specific Components (8 Agents)"
   - Removed SqlAgent and NarrativeAgent components
   - Renamed ChartAgent to VizAgent for consistency
   - Kept the Report Agent in the list (9 total components listed, with 8 active agents in the pipeline)
   - Updated implementation status section to reference "8-Agent Pipeline" instead of "11-Agent Pipeline"

## Correct Agent Structure

The frontend documentation now properly reflects the 8-agent pipeline as specified in structure/11.txt:
1. Data Agent (File Upload Agent)
2. Cleaner Agent (Data Profile Agent)
3. Planning Agent
4. Query Agent
5. Insight Agent
6. Viz Agent
7. Critique Agent
8. Debate Agent
9. Report Agent (shown as final output)

## Files Changed

- `c:\JUL7PROJECT\files\frontend_layout.txt`
- `c:\JUL7PROJECT\files\frontend_files.txt`

## Next Steps

- Ensure all references to agent counts in the codebase are updated to reflect 8 agents
- Verify that the frontend components accurately represent the 8-agent pipeline
- Update any remaining documentation that might reference 11 agents
