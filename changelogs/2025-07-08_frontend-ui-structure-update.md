# Frontend UI Structure Update

**Date:** July 8, 2025  
**Author:** GitHub Copilot  

## Changes Made

Updated the frontend UI structure to match the specifications in structure/11.txt:

1. **Agent Pipeline Correction**:
   - Removed SQL Agent and Narrative Agent (not in the 8-agent pipeline)
   - Renamed "Chart Agent" to "Viz Agent" to match the specification
   - Ensured all 8 agents are properly named and match the structure/11.txt document

2. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Updated frontend_layout.txt to reflect the correct 8-agent pipeline
   - Updated frontend_verification_table.md to describe the correct agent structure
   - Updated all-tasks-completed-summary.md to include the latest changes

3. **Agent Structure Verification**:
   - Confirmed the correct 8 agents according to structure/11.txt:
     1. File Upload Agent (Data Agent)
     2. Data Profile Agent (Cleaner Agent)
     3. Planning Agent
     4. Query Agent
     5. Insight Agent
     6. Viz Agent (renamed from Chart Agent)
     7. Critique Agent
     8. Report Agent
