# 2025-07-08 Home UI Layout Fixes

## Summary
- Removed the "Skip to main content" accessibility link from the layout as per new requirements.
- Ensured the agent workflow glass card is in the right column, not below the chat card.
- Added the bottom full-width dashboard visualization panel to match the reference layout.
- All changes follow project rules in structure/rules.txt.

## Files Changed
- `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`: Removed skip link anchor.
- `frontend/src/app/page.tsx`: Fixed column layout, agent workflow placement, and added dashboard panel.

## Reason
To align the home UI with the reference image and project requirements, and to follow project rules for change logging and structure.
