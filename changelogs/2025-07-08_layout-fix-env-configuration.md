# Layout Fix and Environment Configuration - 2025-07-08

## Summary
This changelog documents the fixes to the 2-column layout issue and the addition of environment configuration files for the frontend.

## Changes

### 1. Layout Fixes
- Fixed the 2-column layout in page.tsx by adding environment variable control
- Enhanced the layout to use `environmentService.layout.forceTwoColumn` flag to enforce horizontal layout
- Ensured the Agent Workflow card appears properly in the right column at all viewport sizes

### 2. Environment Configuration
- Enhanced the .env file with new layout configuration options
- Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_RESPONSIVE_LAYOUT` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_FORCE_TWO_COLUMN` flags
- Updated the `environmentService.ts` to include these new layout properties
- Set up API connection settings, feature flags, and UI configuration options

### 3. Documentation Updates
- Updated the frontend verification table to reflect the layout changes
- Added a note about potential mobile responsiveness considerations

## Technical Implementation
The core issue was that the layout was using responsive classes that would stack the columns vertically on smaller screens:

```tsx
// Before:
<div className="w-full flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-12 justify-center">

// After:
<div className={`w-full flex ${environmentService.layout.forceTwoColumn ? 'flex-row' : 'flex-col md:flex-row'} gap-12 justify-center`}>
```

## Impact
- The UI now properly displays the 2-column layout with Upload/Chat in the left column and Agent Workflow in the right column
- Layout behavior can now be controlled via environment variables
- Environment variables are now accessible to configure API endpoints and feature flags
- Configuration is now consistent with backend expectations

## Next Steps
- Update API client to use the environment variables for endpoints
- Ensure WebSocket connections use the configured WS_URL
- Consider adding environment-specific configurations for different deployment environments
- Optimize mobile layout if needed based on user feedback
