## Changes Implemented

1. Created a comprehensive project understanding document:
   - Added detailed table summarizing project architecture
   - Documented the 8-agent pipeline workflow with dependencies
   - Created an example workflow showcasing the entire process
   - Developed a structured backend development plan

2. The document includes:
   - Project overview and technologies used
   - Agent pipeline architecture with dependencies
   - Step-by-step workflow example using sales data
   - Detailed backend development phases and tasks
   - Technical implementation code examples
   - Next steps for backend development

## Purpose

This document serves as a foundation for backend development, ensuring all components align with the 8-agent vertical pipeline architecture. It will act as a reference guide during the implementation of the FastAPI backend, LangChain agent system, and RAG integration.

## Next Steps

- Begin implementation of the FastAPI backend structure
- Create the agent architecture with LangGraph workflow
- Implement file handling and RAG integration
- Enhance the frontend with improved styling and typography
