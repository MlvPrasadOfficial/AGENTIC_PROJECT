# UI Agent Pipeline Standardization Completion

**Date:** 2025-07-08
**Author:** GitHub Copilot
**Status:** Completed

## Changes Implemented

1. Fixed emoji display issues:
   - Corrected File Upload Agent emoji (üìÅ)
   - Corrected Viz Agent emoji (üìä)

2. Updated file header with correct date and purpose:
   - Changed date to 2025-07-08
   - Updated purpose to reflect 8-agent vertical pipeline implementation

3. Updated agent dependency relationships:
   - Planning Agent now shows "Awaiting Data Profiling" instead of "Queue Position #3"
   - Critique Agent now shows dependencies on Insight Agent and Viz Agent
   - Debate Agent now shows dependency on Critique Agent
   - Report Agent now shows dependency on Debate Agent

4. Verified all agent panels are present in the correct order:
   - File Upload Agent
   - Data Profile Agent (formerly Cleaner Agent)
   - Planning Agent
   - Insight Agent
   - Viz Agent
   - Critique Agent
   - Debate Agent
   - Report Agent

## Verification

The agent pipeline UI now completely matches the correct 8-agent vertical pipeline structure as defined in structure/11.txt. The order, dependencies, and naming of all agents have been standardized across both the UI implementation and documentation.

## Next Steps

- Test the UI layout in different screen sizes
- Implement interactive functionality for the agent pipeline controls
- Develop the actual agent communication logic between the UI components
