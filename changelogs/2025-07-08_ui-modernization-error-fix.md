### Error Identified
When implementing the minimal modern UI design, we encountered compilation errors related to the mixing of old and new component patterns. The specific error was:

```
Error: Ã— Unexpected token `GlassCard`. Expected jsx identifier
```

This occurred because we were attempting to use the old GlassCard component while also introducing new modern design components, creating conflicts in the page structure.

### Fix Implemented
1. Created a completely new implementation of page.tsx with clean structure
2. Removed all references to the old GlassCard components
3. Used only the new minimal modern components with proper styling
4. Ensured consistent component structure throughout the file

### Changes Made
- Simplified component imports to only what's needed
- Created a clean implementation without any references to the old layout
- Maintained the same minimal modern design as intended
- Fixed all syntax errors and component conflicts

This clean implementation resolves all compilation errors while maintaining the desired minimal modern UI design as shown in the reference UI.
