**Author:** GitHub Copilot

## Tasks Completed

### Task 1: Fixed Browse Files Functionality ✅
**Issue**: The "Browse Files" button in the file upload component was not clickable
**Solution**: 
- Removed the manual click handler that was trying to trigger the hidden input
- Leveraged react-dropzone's built-in `getRootProps()` functionality
- Added `cursor-pointer` to the dropzone container
- The entire dropzone area (including the browse button) now properly triggers file selection

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/components/upload/FileUpload.tsx`

**Changes Made**:
- Removed `id="file-upload-input"` from the input element
- Removed `onClick={() => document.getElementById('file-upload-input')?.click()}` from the button
- Added `cursor-pointer` class to the dropzone container
- Simplified the implementation to rely on react-dropzone's native functionality

### Task 2: Professional Navbar Implementation ✅
**Issue**: Navbar was using glassmorphism styling (glass panel appearance)
**Solution**: 
- Replaced glassmorphism with professional, clean design
- Added custom SVG icon for branding
- Implemented gradient text for the title
- Used standard navigation styling with proper hover effects

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/components/layout/Navbar.tsx`
- `frontend/src/app/page.tsx`

**Changes Made**:
- Replaced `glass-card` class with `bg-gray-900/95 border-b border-gray-700/50`
- Added custom SVG icon (analytics/data theme)
- Implemented gradient text effect for title: `bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-400 to-purple-400 bg-clip-text text-transparent`
- Improved typography and spacing
- Enhanced hover effects with smooth transitions
- Added proper spacing to page container (`py-8`)

### Task 3: Changelog Documentation ✅
**Implementation**: 
- Created timestamped changelog following the required format: `changelogs/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS_description.md`
- Documented all changes with technical details
- Included file paths and specific modifications

## Impact Assessment
