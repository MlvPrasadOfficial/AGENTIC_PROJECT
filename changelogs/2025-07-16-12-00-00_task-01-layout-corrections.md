# Task-01 Layout Corrections - July 16, 2025

## Overview
Fixed the 2-column layout structure and full-width visualization panel issues identified in Task-01.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed 2-Column Layout Structure
**File:** `frontend/src/app/page.tsx`
- **Issue:** Layout was displaying as 3 separate cards instead of proper 2-column structure
- **Fix:** 
  - Corrected left column to exactly 40% width with `style={{ width: '40%' }}`
  - Corrected right column to exactly 60% width with `style={{ width: '60%' }}`
  - Added proper CSS classes `left-column` and `right-column` for override styles
  - Increased gap spacing from `gap-4` to `gap-6` for better visual separation

### 2. Enhanced CSS Layout Override
**File:** `frontend/src/app/layout-override.css`
- **Issue:** CSS wasn't properly enforcing 2-column layout
- **Fix:**
  - Added exact width constraints for left column (40%) and right column (60%)
  - Added `!important` declarations to ensure layout integrity
  - Set proper `box-sizing: border-box` for all layout elements
  - Removed viewport-based widths that were causing layout issues

### 3. Full-Width Visualization Panel
**File:** `frontend/src/app/page.tsx`
- **Issue:** Bottom visualization panel needed full-width optimization
- **Fix:**
  - Added explicit `style={{ width: '100%', maxWidth: 'none' }}` to ensure full width
  - Increased margin spacing from `mt-4` to `mt-6` for better separation
  - Maintained proper padding and glass card styling

## Layout Structure Verification
- ✅ Left Column (40%): Contains "Upload your Data" and "Ask Copilot" sections
- ✅ Right Column (60%): Contains "Agent Workflow" section
- ✅ Bottom Panel (100%): "Data Visualization" panel spans full width
- ✅ Responsive behavior maintained for mobile devices

## Technical Details
- Used inline styles combined with CSS classes for maximum layout control
- Maintained glassmorphism design system integrity
- Preserved all existing functionality while fixing layout structure
- Ensured proper responsive behavior with `lg:` breakpoints

## Status
✅ **Task-01 COMPLETED** - 2-column layout is now properly structured with correct proportions and full-width visualization panel.
