**Type:** Layout Enhancement  

## Overview
Successfully completed Task-01 requirements to optimize the 2-column layout structure for Enterprise Insights Copilot application.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Bottom Visualization Panel - Full Width Utilization ✅
- **Issue:** Bottom viz card was not utilizing full screen width
- **Solution:** 
  - Added `viz-panel` CSS class with `width: 100% !important`
  - Enhanced container with `max-w-none` for full width
  - Applied proper CSS overrides to ensure full width usage

### 2. 2-Column Layout Structure Correction ✅
- **Issue:** Layout was not properly displaying as 2 columns with 40%/60% split
- **Solution:**
  - **Left Column (40%):** Contains upload and chat sections
    - Applied `left-column` CSS class with `width: 40% !important`
    - Added `flex-shrink: 0` to prevent column shrinking
    - Ensured proper spacing with `space-y-6`
  
  - **Right Column (60%):** Contains agent workflow section
    - Applied `right-column` CSS class with `width: 60% !important`
    - Added `flex-shrink: 0` to prevent column shrinking
    - Maintained proper flex column structure

### 3. CSS Architecture Enhancements
- **File:** `layout-override.css`
- **Changes:**
  - Added `.main-container` with proper flex layout
  - Added `.left-column` with exact 40% width constraints
  - Added `.right-column` with exact 60% width constraints
