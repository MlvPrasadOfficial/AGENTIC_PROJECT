### üéØ TASK-01: CORE IMPLEMENTATION
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Objective**: Execute git operations, create backend development task, and implement minimal hover animations

#### 1. Git Operations
**Command Executed**: `git add . ; git commit -m "JUL17 2025 USE BASE -- 2.1-2.5 COMPLETED SUCCESS" ; git push origin main`
- **Standard Compliance**: ‚úÖ Note-01 - Used semicolon (;) instead of && for command chaining
- **Execution Mode**: ‚úÖ Note-02 - Executed in foreground as required
- **Result**: Successfully committed and pushed all changes to main branch

#### 2. Backend Development Server Task Creation
**File Modified**: `c:\JUL7PROJECT\.vscode\tasks.json`
- **Task Added**: "Backend Development Server"
- **Command**: `cd backend ; python main.py`
- **Configuration**: Background execution with proper presentation settings
- **Integration**: Matches frontend task structure for consistency

#### 3. G1 G2 Card Hover Animations
**File Modified**: `c:\JUL7PROJECT\frontend\src\app\globals.css`
- **Target Elements**: `.glass-card-primary` (G1) and `.glass-card-secondary` (G2)
- **Animation Type**: Minimal hover effects with subtle elevation
- **Changes Implemented**:
  - G1 Card: `translateY(-2px)` on hover with enhanced shadow depth
  - G2 Card: `translateY(-1px)` on hover with moderate shadow enhancement
  - Added smooth `transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out` for fluid animations
  - Reduced previous elaborate animations to minimal, professional effects

### üéØ TASK-02: CODE QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Objective**: Enhance code quality, documentation, and maintainability

#### 1. File Analysis
**Files Modified in Task-01**:
- `c:\JUL7PROJECT\.vscode\tasks.json` - Backend development server task
- `c:\JUL7PROJECT\frontend\src\app\globals.css` - G1 G2 hover animations

**Documentation Added**:
```css
/* G1 Card: Primary glass card styling with enhanced glassmorphism effects */
/* G1 Card: Minimal hover animation with subtle elevation */
/* G2 Card: Secondary glass card styling with reduced depth */
/* G2 Card: Minimal hover animation with subtle elevation */
```

**Line-by-Line Comments**:
- Background gradient explanations
- Border and shadow purpose documentation
- Transition timing and easing explanations
- Transform and hover effect descriptions

### üìä COMPLIANCE ACHIEVEMENTS

#### ‚úÖ Standards Compliance:
- **Note-01**: ‚úÖ Used semicolon (;) for command chaining in git operations
- **Note-02**: ‚úÖ Executed all commands in foreground mode
- **Note-03**: ‚úÖ Created timestamped changelog documentation
- **Note-04**: ‚úÖ Solved all tasks sequentially with strategy explanation

#### ‚úÖ Task-01 Requirements Met:
- [x] Git operations (add, commit, push) executed successfully
- [x] Backend development server task created and configured
- [x] Minimal hover animations implemented for G1 G2 cards

#### ‚úÖ Task-02 Requirements Met:
- [x] Unused imports/variables/code blocks removed (none found)
- [x] Detailed docstrings and comments added to all modified components
- [x] Comprehensive line-by-line comments provided
- [x] Code quality and maintainability significantly improved

### üîç TECHNICAL DETAILS

#### Animation Specifications:
- **G1 Card (Primary)**:
  - Hover Transform: `translateY(-2px)`
  - Shadow Enhancement: `0 18px 60px rgba(0,0,0,0.35)`
  - Background Opacity: Increased from 0.4 to 0.45
  - Border Visibility: Enhanced from 0.12 to 0.14 opacity

- **G2 Card (Secondary)**:
  - Hover Transform: `translateY(-1px)`
  - Shadow Enhancement: `0 16px 48px rgba(0,0,0,0.3)`
  - Background Opacity: Increased from 0.4 to 0.45
  - Border Visibility: Enhanced from 0.12 to 0.14 opacity

#### Performance Optimizations:
- **Transition Timing**: `0.3s ease-in-out` for smooth animations
- **Transform Efficiency**: Using `translateY()` for GPU acceleration
- **Shadow Optimization**: Balanced shadow depths for performance

### üéØ BUSINESS IMPACT
