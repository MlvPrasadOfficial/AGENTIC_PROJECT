1.5 now after resolving above all 4 issues, 
1.5.1 create a test named 'test_upload' to check the upload success worflow,
   1. it should check given a user uploads a file, the file is getting uploaded successfully, or not (success or failure) to backend
   2. it should show frontend csv from frontend (success or failure)
   3. make sure both are success , write the test to check in terminal for both of them as success


I want have a clear understanding of the project with keen details 



Note-01: Always run commands in the foreground. If a server is running, monitor it in the terminal.
Note-02: front end and backend are running as tasks already, port 3000 and 8000 respectively. 
        if required, you can check frontend working at shell task : 'Next.js Development Server' and backend at shell task : 'Backend Development Server'
Note-03: always use powershell syntax only ( use ; instead of && )
note-04 :always remember 4 notes and start with a strategical approach to solve the tasks

Task-01 : 

2. The code in both frontend and backend is complex and sensitive, so do incremental changes.
    After every change, check for compilation errors in terminal tasks: 'Backend Development Server' (port 8000) and 'Next.js Development Server' (port 3000)
3. Read the entire page you want to edit, for deep understanding of the changes required to do

Task-02: After completing above tasks go to the files created or edited for above tasks,
     1.Remove any unused imports, variables, or code blocks
     2.Add detailed docstrings to all functions and components
     3.Add comprehensive line-by-line comments
     4.Ensure code quality and maintainability
