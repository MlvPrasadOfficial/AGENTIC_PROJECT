strictly follow the notes and context provided below to complete the tasks sequentially and incrementally
Note-01: Always run commands in the foreground. If a server is running, monitor it in the terminal.
Note-02: front end and backend are running as tasks already, port 3000 and 8000 respectively. 
        if required, you can check frontend working at shell task : 'Next.js Development Server' and backend at shell task : 'Backend Development Server'
Note-03: always use powershell syntax only ( use ; instead of && )
note-04 :always remember 4 notes and start with a strategical approach to solve the tasks in a sequential manner

Task-01 : 
1. in the right column : file upload agent card 
1.1 the backend file upload agent returns pinecone 6 test results , which are not being displayed in the frontend
1.2 all   display the pinecone 6 test results in the file upload agent result card

2. The code in both frontend and backend is complex and sensitive, so do incremental changes.
    After every change, check for compilation errors in terminal tasks: 'Backend Development Server' (port 8000) and 'Next.js Development Server' (port 3000)
3. Read the entire page you want to edit, for deep understanding of the changes required to do

Task-02:
After completing above tasks go to the files created or edited for above tasks,
     1.Remove any unused imports, variables, or code blocks
     2.Add detailed docstrings to all functions and components
     3.Add comprehensive line-by-line comments
     4.Ensure code quality and maintainability
     5.In the end check whether front end task and backend task are running fine or not, if not fix them
