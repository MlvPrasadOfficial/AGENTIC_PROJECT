Note-01: Always run commands in the foreground. If a server is running, monitor it in the terminal.
Note-02: front end and backend are running as tasks already, port 3000 and 8000 respectively. 
        if required, you can check frontend working at shell task : 'Next.js Development Server' and backend at shell task : 'Backend Development Server'
Note-03: always use powershell syntax only ( use ; instead of && )
note-04 :always remember 4 notes and start with a strategical approach to solve the tasks

Task-01 : 
1. I have shared a screenshot of the frontend UI, which shows the file upload section and agent workflow.

   1.2.6 pincone test 5 along with passed, what is vector count after embedding,
   2. The code in both frontend and backend is complex and sensitive, so do incremental changes.
    After every change, check for compilation errors in terminal tasks: 'Backend Development Server' (port 8000) and 'Next.js Development Server' (port 3000)
    3. Read the entire page you want to edit, for deep understanding of the changes required to do
